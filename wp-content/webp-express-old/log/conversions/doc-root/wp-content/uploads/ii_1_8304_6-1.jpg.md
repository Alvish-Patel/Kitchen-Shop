Converting to lossy
Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: version: *1.0.3*
We could get the version, so yes, a plain cwebp call works
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 2 binaries: 
- /usr/bin/cwebp
- /bin/cwebp
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 1 binaries: 
- /usr/bin/cwebp
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Linux)... We do. We in fact have 3

Detecting versions of the cwebp binaries found
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: version: *1.0.3*
- Executing: /usr/bin/cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: version: *1.0.3*
- Executing: /bin/cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: version: *1.0.3*
Binaries ordered by version number.
- cwebp: (version: 1.0.3)
- /usr/bin/cwebp: (version: 1.0.3)
- /bin/cwebp: (version: 1.0.3)
Trying the first of these. If that should fail (it should not), the next will be tried and so on.

Quality of source is 99. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
